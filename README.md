# peterson Puppies  
I created this website for a client who's dog just had her first litter of puppies and they needed help with the marketing.  
The focus was on being adorable and giving the clients all the information they needed to decide a Goldendoodle was the dog for them.
  
 I spent a good amount of time learning about metta data for this project so when the link is sent over text or facebook it shows a good thunbnail showing off the puppies.
