# peterson Puppies  
I created this website for a client who's dog just had her first litter of puppies and they needed help with the marketing.  
The focus was on being adorable and giving the clients all the information they needed to decide if a Goldendoodle is the right choice for them.
  
 I spent a good amount of time learning about metta data for this project so when the link is sent over text or facebook it shows a good thunbnail showing off the puppies.  
 Check out the site that is up and running at https://petersonpups.herokuapp.com/
